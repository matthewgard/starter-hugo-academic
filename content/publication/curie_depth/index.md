abstract: The depth to the Curie isotherm provides a snapshot into the deep thermal conditions of the crust, which helps constrain models of thermally controlled physical properties and processes. In this study, we present an updated global Curie depth model by employing the equivalent source dipole method to fit the lithospheric magnetic field model LCS-1 from spherical harmonic degree 16 to 100. In addition to the new field mode, we utilise all three vector components and include a laterally variable magnetic susceptibility model. We also employ an improved thermal model, TC1, to supplement the degree 1 to 15 components that are otherwise contaminated by the core field. Our new Curie depth model differs by as much as Â±20 km relative to previous models, with the largest differences arising from the low order thermal model and variable susceptibility. Key differences are found in central Africa due to application of a variable susceptibility model, and shield regions, but continents with poor constraints such as Antarctica require additional improvement. This new Curie depth model shows good agreement with continental heat flow observations, and provides further evidence that Curie depth estimates may be used to constrain evaluations of the thermal state of the continental lithosphere, especially in regions with sparse or surface contaminated heat flow observations.
